## Using the Agile Methodology in Oracle Developer Cloud Service ##

### About this tutorial ###
**Oracle Developer Cloud Service** is an integrated DevOps platform that enables projects planing and management by:
+ using Agile methodology to manage and track development sprints
+ using Issue Tracking to manage, track and prioritize tasks, and to manage defects, and features
+ using Team Management to assign ownership and track team execution

This tutorial shows how to use the Issue and Agile tabs of Oracle Developer Cloud Service to develop your project using Agile methodology.

To develop your project using Agile methodology, follow the instruction in the tutorial [Using Agile Methodology in Oracle Developer Cloud Service](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/developer/AgileDevelopment/AgileDevelopment.html).

**NOTE:** Start following the instruction directly from section Creating a Project and Some Issues, point 6 (Once project provisioning is completed, you are automatically taken to your new projectâ€™s Project page. Click the Issues tab.)

You can play and improvise with Agile instruction (names of issues, tasks etc.) to match your springboot-sample project.
