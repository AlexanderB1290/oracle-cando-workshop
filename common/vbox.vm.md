## On premise environment needed for some of the Labs ##

**Oracle Virtual Box image**

Some of the Labs are supported by an Oracle Virtual Box image. 
Contact your local oracle representative or george.moykin@oracle.com to obtain a copy of the Oracle CanDo VBox image distributive.

**Eclipse IDE with Oracle Cloud Tools plugin**

You need Eclipse IDE with Oracle Cloud Tools plugin or Oracle Enterprise Plugin for Eclipse installed either:
    + by importing distributed by Oracle Virtual Box image
    + or by installing Eclipse IDE with Oracle Cloud Tools plugin or Oracle Enterprise Plugin for Eclipse into your local system

You can download the Eclipse IDE from [http://www.eclipse.org/](http://www.eclipse.org/) and OEPE from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html).

If you are using the Eclipse IDE, download and install the Oracle Cloud Tools plugin from the [Eclipse IDE marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/oracle-cloud-tools). In OEPE, the plugin is installed by default.
