## On-premise environment needed for some of the Labs ##

**Oracle Virtual Box image**

Some of the Labs are supported by the Oracle Virtual Box image [cando-vbox](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1e5RMycoBxhMDJ1dHBNZk5DUUE). 


**Eclipse IDE with Oracle Cloud Tools plugin**

You need Eclipse IDE with Oracle Cloud Tools plugin or Oracle Enterprise Plugin for Eclipse installed either:
+ by importing distributed by Oracle Virtual Box image
+ or by installing Eclipse IDE with Oracle Cloud Tools plugin or Oracle Enterprise Plugin for Eclipse (OEPE) into your local system

You can download the Eclipse IDE from [http://www.eclipse.org/](http://www.eclipse.org/) and OEPE from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html).

If you are using the Eclipse IDE, download and install the Oracle Cloud Tools plugin from the [Eclipse IDE marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/oracle-cloud-tools). In OEPE, the plugin is installed by default.
